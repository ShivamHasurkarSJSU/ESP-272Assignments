## GitOps: An Overview

GitOps is a modern paradigm that uses Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. This approach allows developers to use familiar tools to manage infrastructure and operations tasks.

## Case Study

We explored a real-life case study on how Goibibo employs GitOps for efficient and streamlined travel services, showcasing the benefits realized from this approach.

## CI/CD Pipeline

For the software artifact from previous assignments, we've constructed a CI/CD pipeline using tools of our choice, with the inclusion of an automated trigger for build/deploy processes.

### Tooling Decision

The choice of CI/CD tools and the rationale behind these decisions are documented, along with the challenges faced and the solutions implemented during the setup of the automated pipeline.

## Pipeline Execution

Screenshots and detailed explanations of the pipeline in action are provided to illustrate the build and deployment processes.
