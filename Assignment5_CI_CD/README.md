## GitOps: An Overview

GitOps is a modern paradigm that uses Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. This approach allows developers to use familiar tools to manage infrastructure and operations tasks. The added document will explain GitOps in detail

## Case Study

We explored a real-life case study on how Goibibo employs GitOps for efficient and streamlined travel services, showcasing the benefits realized from this approach. Please refer the Documentation for the same

## CI/CD Pipeline

For the software artifact from previous assignments, we've constructed a CI/CD pipeline using tools of our choice, with the inclusion of an automated trigger for build/deploy processes.

### Tooling Decision

The choice of CI/CD tools and the rationale behind these decisions are documented, along with the challenges faced and the solutions implemented during the setup of the automated pipeline.

## Pipeline Execution

Screenshots and detailed explanations of the pipeline in action are provided to illustrate the build and deployment processes.
